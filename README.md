# Pulsar Electron Next Binaries

This repository provides rolling releases of Pulsar for testing with the latest Electron version, or close to that.

(The "Electron Next" phrasing is primarily meant to contribute to a descriptive and unambiguous repository URL. We may informally call these builds "Pulsar-next", "Pulsar Electron-next", etc. Name is still TBD and is mainly a placeholder name to be used dring this early testing period, not necessarily intended as a permanent product name/project name or permanent branding. Thank you for your understanding.)
